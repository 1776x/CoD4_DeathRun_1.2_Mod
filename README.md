DeathRun 1.2 Mod for CoD4
=========================
Deathrun is a mod in which a single player fights alone against the other team, his only weapons are his deadly traps.
The players in the opposite team have to kill the trapmaster (aka. activator) after finishing his course without dying. 
As of this day, more than 4 years after it's initial release, it's still one of the most popular CoD4 mods along with ProMod and CodJumper.

Have fun with that code, would be nice if you commited something back to the mod if you find it worthy =)
Extract deathrun_dev to your cod4/mods directory and run makeMod.bat, press D (you're copying directories) if asked
and then run makeIWD.bat to build .IWD files.
